## About
This is the repository for a new portfolio using React.js. So far the application is looking alittle bare as I did not start on the CSS in time. I decided to go with a single scrolling portfolio page instead of one with multiple pages. The navgation on tope does work and will bring you to the proper areas.
However, this application will be fully updated in the next few days.
