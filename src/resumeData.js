I graduated from a small college called Wentworth Institue of Technology, located in Boston, Massachusetts. In 2018, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Business Management with a focus in entrepreneurship. I then went on to go work for a company called Aktina Medical. I work as the Production Planner. Outside of regular work, I coach Olympic weightlifting online. I've been coaching for almost 3 years and I love my clients. When I have time to enjoy myself, I do enjoy playing video games. I currently stream on Twitch.Tv when I have the time and I am usually playing some party games with my friends. I like to play many first-person-shooter (FPS) games, like Valorant, Apex Legends, Halo, and many others When I want to disconnect from the online world, I like to work on cars. I am currently working on my own Honda S2000, getting it ready to take it to the track in spring 2021.",
